Algorithms follow along a design pattern.
For Flow diagrams: (for steps)
    - Circles indicate start and stops.
    - Round boxes indicate a process.
    - Diamonds indicate decisions with yes or no output paths.
    - "columned" boxes are for a complex process or external dependency.
    For Component diagrams: (for relationships)
    - Rectangles for major building blocks.
    - Arrows to indicate what initiates system interaction.
Don't mix flow and components.
Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard language for building diagrams.
C4 diagrams are the latest form of diagrams commonly used right now.
