CS2450 Journal

Date: 8/29/25 - Subject: Class

For our class today we created a git repo. This would've been helpful earlier in my degree, but atleast it feels like review for my IT4200 class.
I find it funny I'm taking a class teaching about asymmetric encryption like its the first time I've heard it when its my last semester.

Be kind to Quality Testers. 
Project managers may be annoying, but we can avoid them annoying us by being more accurate with estimations.
DevOps exists because deployment time has significantly decreased. Emergency room doctors.
When using pip install, using the --break-system-packages is sometimes needed. This flag is to skip over protection, since some installations can break the python installation or the OS.

Two important things for Software Engineers:
- Someone who understands and can communicate the requirements (Take initiative if its no one)
- Smart people who can build stuff
Possibly build a login system with a database attached? (school vm website?)

Users Stories: As a ... I want ... so that ... .
A burndown chart with a scoring system is used to measure progress. Points are from the fibonacci sequence to be arbitrary.

Pictures/diagrams can be used for both high level and low level people and are effective for both.
Algorithms follow along a design pattern.

For Flow diagrams: (for steps)

    - Circles indicate start and stops.
    - Round boxes indicate a process.
    - Diamonds indicate decisions with yes or no output paths.
    - "columned" boxes are for a complex process or external dependency.

For Component diagrams: (for relationships)

    - Rectangles for major building blocks.
    - Arrows to indicate what initiates system interaction.

Don't mix flow and components.
Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard language for building diagrams.
C4 diagrams are the latest form of diagrams commonly used right now.

Pitch Presentation is to show stakeholders the preperation that has been done.
For class, the general message that needs to come across is "I have done my homework".
Start working on the bootstrap and .css/styling early. Previous students found it hardest to do.
We start coding now.
Our audience is a technical one. Cost and time estimations don't matter in this environment.
Focus on Audience, Goals, and Principles for Presentations.
7 +- 2 objects per page.
Show something twice to really make audience remember.

Gannt charts are a way to measure progress on a project using a bar graph to predict how long each task will take and to determine dependencies.
Gannt charts are often done poorly, and its till hard to predict progress done with each task and when itll get done.
Kanban Board (seeing board) is a method of writing out tasks on a board and marking them if they are todo, in progress, or done.
Kanban lets engineers pick what to code, not a project manager. Lets managers see what is done and in progress.
In big companies, if engineers use kanban, it is likely someone is still using a gannt chart.

Stakeholders: Users, engineers, management, investors, support, sales, designers, etc 
each stakeholder has a different definition of done. Agree with stakeholders on what "done" is.

Use kanban board for the rest of the semester.

Most companies have people who know how to do the technical skills, but struggle with communication in those teams.

Agile Manifesto: (Made by people who made the agile process. List of "bright minds" in software development.) A basis of thinking for making good software.

Companies that can repspond to change stuck around, companies that stuck to the plan crashed and burned.

Programs sometimes are responsible for ethical decisions. What we program can also have ethical implications.
Computers aren't good at nuance, even with AI. Humans have to make decisions ahead of time what is a reasonable reaction.

Trolley problem: Pulling the lever is more ethical than pushing someone onto the track when both actions stop the trolley. To a computer, its hard to differentiate the two when the outcome is the same.

Can AI or a program understand ethics, or is it picking something that has a predetermined higher value than another thing?

Intent vs. Consequence: Is social media, that meant to connect people for good, an ethical concern for employees if it actually hurts its users?

Exploitation vs. Entertainment: Does a gambling machine exploit addiction, or is it a form of entertainment?

Personal vs. Professional Ethics: Can you or is it ethical to take a job where you disagree with the companies mission? Can you compartmentalize your personal ethics? Should you?

How much personal responsibility do you give to yourself and your users?
