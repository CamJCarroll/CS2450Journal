CS2450 Journal

Date: 8/29/25 - Subject: Class

For our class today we created a git repo. This would've been helpful earlier in my degree, but atleast it feels like review for my IT4200 class.
I find it funny I'm taking a class teaching about asymmetric encryption like its the first time I've heard it when its my last semester.

Be kind to Quality Testers. 
Project managers may be annoying, but we can avoid them annoying us by being more accurate with estimations.
DevOps exists because deployment time has significantly decreased. Emergency room doctors.
When using pip install, using the --break-system-packages is sometimes needed. This flag is to skip over protection, since some installations can break the python installation or the OS.

Two important things for Software Engineers:
- Someone who understands and can communicate the requirements (Take initiative if its no one)
- Smart people who can build stuff
Possibly build a login system with a database attached? (school vm website?)

Users Stories: As a ... I want ... so that ... .
A burndown chart with a scoring system is used to measure progress. Points are from the fibonacci sequence to be arbitrary.

Pictures/diagrams can be used for both high level and low level people and are effective for both.
Algorithms follow along a design pattern.

For Flow diagrams: (for steps)

    - Circles indicate start and stops.
    - Round boxes indicate a process.
    - Diamonds indicate decisions with yes or no output paths.
    - "columned" boxes are for a complex process or external dependency.

For Component diagrams: (for relationships)

    - Rectangles for major building blocks.
    - Arrows to indicate what initiates system interaction.

Don't mix flow and components.
Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard language for building diagrams.
C4 diagrams are the latest form of diagrams commonly used right now.

Pitch Presentation is to show stakeholders the preperation that has been done.
For class, the general message that needs to come across is "I have done my homework".
Start working on the bootstrap and .css/styling early. Previous students found it hardest to do.
We start coding now.
Our audience is a technical one. Cost and time estimations don't matter in this environment.
Focus on Audience, Goals, and Principles for Presentations.
7 +- 2 objects per page.
Show something twice to really make audience remember.

Review of component diagram needed. (friday)
Ideas from presentations:

- SAHW - Plundr: User Profiles, Forums, general chat/tavern, group/crew chats.
- DEECS (us) - MySpy: How will users hear about MySpy? Group chats/forums.
- DOOF - Inator-inator: Evil, chatbot?, Follow from group chats.
- Other: Default private posts (only friends), option to make public posts.

Ideas from presentations Wednesday:
Flask login, Jinja template to full funamic content, Flask route (messaging)

Gannt charts are a way to measure progress on a project using a bar graph to predict how long each task will take and to determine dependencies.
Gannt charts are often done poorly, and its till hard to predict progress done with each task and when itll get done.
Kanban Board (seeing board) is a method of writing out tasks on a board and marking them if they are todo, in progress, or done.
Kanban lets engineers pick what to code, not a project manager. Lets managers see what is done and in progress.
In big companies, if engineers use kanban, it is likely someone is still using a gannt chart.

Stakeholders: Users, engineers, management, investors, support, sales, designers, etc 
each stakeholder has a different definition of done. Agree with stakeholders on what "done" is.

Use kanban board for the rest of the semester.

Most companies have people who know how to do the technical skills, but struggle with communication in those teams.

Agile Manifesto: (Made by people who made the agile process. List of "bright minds" in software development.) A basis of thinking for making good software.

Companies that can repspond to change stuck around, companies that stuck to the plan crashed and burned.

Programs sometimes are responsible for ethical decisions. What we program can also have ethical implications.
Computers aren't good at nuance, even with AI. Humans have to make decisions ahead of time what is a reasonable reaction.

Trolley problem: Pulling the lever is more ethical than pushing someone onto the track when both actions stop the trolley. To a computer, its hard to differentiate the two when the outcome is the same.


Date : 10/17/25

Can AI or a program understand ethics, or is it picking something that has a predetermined higher value than another thing?

Intent vs. Consequence: Is social media, that meant to connect people for good, an ethical concern for employees if it actually hurts its users?

Exploitation vs. Entertainment: Does a gambling machine exploit addiction, or is it a form of entertainment?

Personal vs. Professional Ethics: Can you or is it ethical to take a job where you disagree with the companies mission? Can you compartmentalize your personal ethics? Should you?

How much personal responsibility do you give to yourself and your users?

Now moving onto the validation phase.

Software Quality does what it says, is easy to use, secure, predictible, and persistant.
Improve quality by testing, planning, building architecture, and focusing on subsystems.

1. Quality is built in the ground up and is the foremost responsibility of the developer.
2. To 'ensure' quality a solid regiment of rigorous testing must occur.
3. You're never going to be 100% positive.

Should be able to manage users and logins, make persistant posts, identified extra libraries/dependencies, have POC code, and have an understanding of the css.

About four weeks left of the project. Grade isn't on the completion of the project, but on the presentation of our process of going through software engineering. Contents of the backlog and project artifacts will be graded.

Refactoring benefits are maintainability, re-usability, performance, and cost reduction. Helps with not writing the same code multiple times.

Technical debt is a term that buisness people can better understand for refactoring.

Burndown charts, kanban boards, github issues, and iterations are used in regular buisnesses. What we are actually doing is what software engineers actually do.

In industry, your work is a dependency for a lot of other peoples work. Hundreds of people work on one thing.

Some software engineers can have the expectation to know how to deploy their code as well. There can be the software engineers, devops, and infrastructure people. Devops sits inbetween and owns the pipeline itself.

Software engineer is a good role to see everything and to jump to other roles like infrastructure. Where you start isn't where you will go/end up at. Job transfer is more than possible.

python for ai or data analysis, javascript for frontend/website, java springboot for enterprise software. Some industries don't deal with C++. Which language a company uses usually depends on the industry.
